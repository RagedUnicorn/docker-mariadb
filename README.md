# docker-mariadb

> A docker base image to build a container for MariaDB based on Ubuntu

This image is intended to build a base for providing a database to an application stack.

## Version

* MariaDB 10

## Using the image

#### Start container

The container can be easily started with `docker-compose` command.

Note that the container itself won't be very useful by itself. The default port `3306` is only
exposed to linked containers. Meaning a connection with a client to the database is not possible with the default configuration.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Stop container

To stop all services from the docker-compose file

```
docker-compose down
```

### Creating a stack

To create a stack the specific `docker-compose.stack.yml` file can be used. It requires that you already built the image that is consumed by the stack or that it is available in a reachable docker repository.

```
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

**Note:** You will get a warning that external secrets are not supported by docker-compose if you try to use this file with docker-compose.

#### Join a swarm

```
docker swarm init
```

#### Create secrets
```
echo "some_password" | docker secret create com.ragedunicorn.mariadb.root_password -
echo "app_user" | docker secret create com.ragedunicorn.mariadb.app_user -
echo "app_user_password" | docker secret create com.ragedunicorn.mariadb.app_user_password -
```

#### Deploy stack
```
docker stack deploy --compose-file=docker-compose.stack.yml [stackname]
```

For a production deployment a stack should be deployed. The secret will then be taken into account and MariaDB will be setup accordingly.

## Dockery

In the dockery folder are some scripts that help out avoiding retyping long docker commands but are mostly intended for playing around with the container. For production use docker-compose or docker stack should be used.

#### Build Image

The build script builds a container with a defined name

```
sh dockery/dbuild.sh
```

#### Run container

Runs the built container. If the container was already run once it will `docker start` the already present container instead of using `docker run`

```
sh dockery/drun.sh
```

#### Attach container

Attaching to the container after it is running

```
sh dockery/dattach.sh
```

#### Stop container

Stopping the running container

```
sh dockery/dstop.sh
```

## Configuration

Most of the configuration can be changed with the `my.cnf` and `mysqld_charset.cnf` configuration files. Both of those files are copied into the container on buildtime. After a change to one of those files the container must be rebuilt.

#### Build Args

The image allows for certain arguments being overridden by build args.

`MARIADB_USER, MARIADB_GROUP, MARIADB_APP_USER, MARIADB_APP_PASSWORD, MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD`

They all have a default value and don't have to be overridden. For details see the Dockerfile.

#### Default user

First time starting up the container a user based on the values of `MARIADB_APP_USER` and `MARIADB_APP_PASSWORD` environmental values is created. This user is also allowed to make external connections and can be used by other services to interact with the database. To modify the setup of this users have a look into `config/user.sql`.

## Persistence

The container is storing data in the docker volume configured by the environment variable `${MARIADB_DATA_DIR}`.

## Healthcheck

The production and the stack image supports a simple healthcheck whether the container is healthy or not. This can be configured inside `docker-compose.yml` or `docker-compose.stack.yml`.

## Test

To do basic tests of the structure of the container use the `docker-compose.test.yml` file.

`docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up`

For more info see [container-test](https://github.com/RagedUnicorn/docker-container-test).

Tests can also be run by category such as command, fileExistence and metadata tests by starting single services in `docker-compose.test.yml`.

```
# basic file existence tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-test
# command tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-test-command
# metadata tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-test-metadata
```

The same tests are also available for the `dev-image`

```
# basic file existence tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-dev-test
# command tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-dev-test-command
# metadata tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-dev-test-metadata
```

## Development

To debug the container and get more insight into the container use the `docker-compose-dev.yml`
configuration. This will also allow external clients to connect to the database. By default the port `3306` will be publicly exposed.

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
```

By default the launchscript `/docker-entrypoint.sh` will not be used to start the MariaDB process. Instead the container will be setup to keep `stdin_open` open and allocating a pseudo `tty`. This allows for connecting to a shell and work on the container. A shell can be opened inside the container with `docker attach [container-id]`. MariaDB itself can be started with `./docker-entrypoint.sh`.
